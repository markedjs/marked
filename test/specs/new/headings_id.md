### Heading with <em>html</em>

### Heading with a [link](http://github.com/)

### Heading with some _italic text_

### Or some **strong**
(which doesn't really make any difference, here)

### Or even `code`

### What about ~~strikethrough~~

## And a ref [link][destination]

[destination]: /some/url "link to nowhere"
