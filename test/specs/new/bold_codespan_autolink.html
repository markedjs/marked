<p><strong>Really weird edge case: bold around what looks like it might be a link, but is actually a link-looking thing with a code specifier in. <a href="https://github.com">Like <code>this</code></a>`. It&#39;s now impossible to close the bold</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Bold text with [unmatched `backtick](url) should close</strong>.</p>
